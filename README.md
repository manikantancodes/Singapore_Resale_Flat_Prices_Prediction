# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction


The project will involve the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
    - Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date.
    - Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
    - Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
    - Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests).
    - Train the model on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.

5. **Streamlit Web Application**:
    - Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey range, etc.).
    - Utilize the trained machine learning model to predict the resale price based on user inputs.

6. **Deployment on Render**:
    - Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.
